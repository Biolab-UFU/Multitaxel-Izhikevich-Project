Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)
Three 12-bit analog-to-digital converters are embedded and each ADC shares up to 16
external channels, performing conversions in the single-shot or scan mode. In scan mode,
automatic conversion is performed on a selected group of analog inputs.
Additional logic functions embedded in the ADC interface allow:
•Simultaneous sample and hold
•Interleaved sample and hold
The ADC can be served by the DMA controller. An analog watchdog feature allows very
precise monitoring of the converted voltage of one, some or all selected channels. An
interrupt is generated when the converted voltage is outside the programmed thresholds.
To synchronize A/D conversion and timers, the ADCs could be triggered by any of TIM1,
TIM2, TIM3, TIM4, TIM5, or TIM8 timer.
